# Next.js Project Starter

Welcome to the Next.js Project Starter repository! This repository is designed to help you kickstart your Next.js projects with a solid foundation and best practices in mind. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with Next.js, this starter code will save you time and help you build powerful web applications efficiently.

## Features

- **Next.js**: Harness the power of Next.js, a popular React framework that offers server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and other performance optimizations.

- **React**: Build your user interfaces using React, a widely-used JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.

- **Routing**: Take advantage of Next.js's built-in routing system to create SEO-friendly, client-side navigation for your app.

- **Styled Components**: Use styled-components to style your components with ease and maintainable CSS-in-JS.

- **ESLint and Prettier**: Ensure code consistency and catch errors early with ESLint and Prettier configurations included.

- **Customizable Configuration**: Easily customize your project's configuration and add additional libraries or tools as needed.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin working with this Next.js project starter in Visual Studio Code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)**: Next.js relies on Node.js. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/), which includes npm.

   To verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly, open your terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v

   ```

2. **Visual Studio Code**: You can download Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from [code.visualstudio.com](code.visualstudio.com). It's a lightweight, highly customizable code editor with excellent support for JavaScript and React development.

After installing VS Code, you might want to consider installing some useful extensions for web development, such as **"ESLint"** for code linting and **"Prettier"** for code formatting. You can install extensions from the VS Code marketplace.

## Getting Started
